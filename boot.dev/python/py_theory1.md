Python is interpreted.
Well known to be used in the fields covering:
Backend web servers
DevOps and cloud engineering
Machine learning
Scripting and automation
etc...

In pyton you can use numbers inside print function
```py
    print((250 + 241 + 244 + 255) / 4)
```

# Variables 
Variables are called "variables" because they can hold any value and that value can change (it varies).
```python
my_height = 100
my_name = "Lane"
print(my_height)
```

# Storing Results
```py
summation = a + b  # Addition
difference = a - b # Subtraction
product = a * b    # Multiplication
quotient = a / b   # Division
```

# Single LineComments
```python
# speed describes how fast the player
# moves in meters per second
speed = 2
```

# Multi-line comments
```python
"""
    the code found below
    will print 'Hello, World!' to the console
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

# Variable names - snake_case ‚ùó

# Variable types 

# Integer
x = 5 # positive integer
y = -5 # negative integer

# Float
z = 3.14 # positive float
w = -3.14 # negative float

# String
a = "Hello" # string
b = 'World' # string

# Boolean
c = True # boolean
d = False # boolean

# F-STRINGS
```python
name = "Yarl"
age = 37
race = "dwarf"

print(f"{name} is a {race} who is {age} years old.")

```

# None
my_mental_acuity = None

# Dynamic typing
Python is dynamically typed, which means a variable can store any type, and that type can change.


# Concatenation
```python
first_name = "Lane "
last_name = "Wagner"
full_name = first_name + last_name
print(full_name)
# prints "Lane Wagner"
```

# Multi-Variable Declaration
```python
sword_name, sword_damage, sword_length = "Excalibur", 10, 200
```

# Functions
```python
def area_of_circle(r):
    pi = 3.14
    result = pi * r * r
    return result
```
# No hoisting
if you define a function, you can't call that function until after it has been defined.
Most Python developers solve this problem by defining all the functions in their program first, then they call an "entry point" function last. That way all of the functions have been read by the Python interpreter before the first one is called.
Conventionally this "entry point" function is usually called main to keep things simple and consistent.

```python
def main():
    health = 10
    armor = 5
    add_armor(health, armor)

def add_armor(h, a):
    new_health = h + a
    print_health(new_health)

def print_health(new_health):
    print(f"The player now has {new_health} health")

# call entrypoint last
main()
```

# None Return
When no return value is specified in a function, it will automatically return None.

# Multiple return values
```python
def cast_iceblast(wizard_level, start_mana):
    damage = wizard_level * 2
    new_mana = start_mana - 10
    return damage, new_mana # return two values
```

# Parameter vs Argument
Parameters are the names used for inputs when defining a function. Arguments are the values of the inputs supplied when a function is called.
```python
# a and b are parameters
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# 5 and 6 are arguments
sum = add(5, 6)
```

# Default Values
A default value is created by using the assignment (=) operator in the function signature.
```python
def get_greeting(email, name="there"):
    print("Hello", name, "welcome! You've registered your email:", email)
```


# LOOP STEP 
Complete the sum_of_odd_numbers function. It should calculate the sum of all the odd numbers starting at 1 up to (but not including) the given end number and return the result.

```py
    def sum_of_odd_numbers(end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, end, 2):
        total += i
    return total
```

```python
    def countdown_to_start():
    for i in range(10, 0, -1):
        if i == 1:
            print(f"{i}...Fight!")
        else:
            print(f"{i}...")
```
